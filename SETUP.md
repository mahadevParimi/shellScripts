# MY PERSONAL USE CASE
 1. I use this command everyday
 2. I'll open the terminal using my keyboard shortcut and search using the command
 3. To avoid using trackpad, multiple clicks which is a slow process
 4. Sometimes, the browser takes time to start
 5. So, it takes extra time for us to input the text into the search box
 6. If I want to search the same query on other website, I'll just go to the previous command in the terminal and change the last argument
 7. This process is fast as this involves less clicks
